            This project focused on solving a critical issue in a fintech app where users were mistakenly sending money to the wrong bank accounts‚Äîcosting the business thousands of dollars weekly in chargebacks. By identifying the root cause through user interviews and flow analysis, I worked with the team to redesign the send-money flow, implement necessary validation checks, and eliminate a backend API bug. The outcome? Zero customer errors, zero chargebacks from this issue, and a more thoughtful, error-resistant experience.

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>Every week, 3 to 7 customers were mistakenly sending money to the wrong accounts using our multi-currency transfer platform. This wasn‚Äôt just a minor UX issue‚Äîit was costing the company thousands of dollars in chargebacks, lost funds, and hours of internal recovery work.</p>
          <p>We needed to understand what was going wrong, why it was happening all of a sudden, and how we could fix it‚Äîfast.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Stakes</h2>
          <p>The cost wasn‚Äôt just financial. The issue was:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Eroding customer trust</li>
            <li>Reducing transaction frequency, especially for users who had already experienced the error</li>
            <li>Overloading support teams who spent hours trying to retrieve funds</li>
            <li>Harming our reputation, especially in regions where trust in digital financial services is still fragile</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This wasn‚Äôt just a bug‚Äîit was a potential growth blocker.</p>

          <h2>Actions</h2>
      
          <h3>üîç Investigating the Why</h3>
          <p>I reached out to our customer support team to dig deeper:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How often were errors happening?</li>
            <li>Which countries or banks were most affected?</li>
            <li>Was this isolated to new users or long-time customers?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From there, I jumped into phone interviews with affected users (3‚Äì15 mins each), documenting exactly how they used the feature.</p>
          
          <figure>

            class="research ProjectImages">
            <figcaption><small>Real calls with real users</small></figcaption>
          </figure>
      
          <h4>Key insights:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Users only realized the mistake after the recipient flagged it.</li>
            <li>Most errors happened during bank transfers.</li>
            <li>A bug in the payouts API auto-switched ‚ÄúGC Bank‚Äù to ‚ÄúPolaris Bank‚Äù on the confirmation screen.</li>
            <li>Most users were not new‚Äîmeaning this wasn‚Äôt an onboarding issue.</li>
            <li>They could clearly walk me through how they sent money‚Äîso the issue wasn‚Äôt usability, it was invisible friction.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>Redesigning the Flow</h3>
          <p>Armed with evidence, I worked with the product and engineering teams to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Highlight the API bug causing bank name swaps</li>
            <li>Redraw the entire ‚ÄúSend Money to Bank‚Äù flow</li>
            <li>Identify where things were falling apart</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Sometimes, clarity comes from zooming out. Mapping the full journey made the issue‚Äîand opportunity‚Äîobvious.</p>
          </blockquote>
      
          <h3>Adding Better Checks</h3>
          <p>Speed was hurting trust. We needed to slow users down just enough to keep them safe. I introduced:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review screens with clearer account + bank details</li>
            <li>Confirmation modals asking users to double-check before submitting</li>
            <li>Error states and catchpoints for known risky banks</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>‚ùå Chargebacks due to user error = 0</li>
            <li>üí∏ No lost funds from sending errors</li>
            <li>üìâ Support tickets related to wrong transfers disappeared</li>
            <li>üí° Internal teams now review flows with more attention to ‚Äútoo-smooth‚Äù paths that skip critical checks</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>This project taught me a key lesson:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Just because something is fast and simple doesn't mean it's safe."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In UX, we're often told to reduce steps and simplify flows‚Äîbut sometimes, the absence of friction is the very thing that causes errors.</p>
          <p>By slowing users down strategically, we actually improved trust and performance.</p>
